  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><em>Last updated: TODAY'S DATE</em></p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Arcline</strong> (“we”, “us”, or “our”)
    collects, uses, and protects information in connection with our AI readiness
    and data quality services for construction and trade businesses.
  </p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Contact information you provide (such as name and email address).</li>
    <li>
      Accounting and operational data you authorize us to access from third-party
      platforms (for example, QuickBooks Online) solely for the purpose of
      computing metrics and readiness insights.
    </li>
    <li>Basic technical information such as logs and diagnostics for support.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
  <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide and improve our AI readiness and analytics services.</li>
    <li>Generate metrics, summaries, and ROI estimates for your business.</li>
    <li>Communicate with you about your account, results, and support.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell your data. We may share information with service providers
    who help us operate the service (for example, hosting and analytics
    providers) and only as necessary to perform their work for us.
  </p>

  <h2>Third-Party Platforms</h2>
  <p>
    When you connect third-party accounts (such as QuickBooks Online),
    we access only the data needed to compute metrics and insights that you
    requested. Your access tokens are stored securely and are not shared or
    resold.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    We use reasonable technical and organizational safeguards to protect the
    information we process. However, no method of transmission or storage is
    completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
  </p>

  <h2>Your Choices</h2>
  <p>
    You may request that we delete data associated with your account, subject
    to any legal or contractual obligations to retain it.
  </p>
