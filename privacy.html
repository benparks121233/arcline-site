    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted"><em>Last updated: January 4, 2026</em></p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Arcline</strong> (“Arcline”, “we”, “us”, or “our”)
      collects, uses, and protects information in connection with our AI readiness and
      data-quality services for construction and trade businesses (the “Service”).
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect the following categories of information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Contact information.</strong> Name, email address, and other basic contact
        details you provide when you contact us or participate in a pilot (for example,
        <a href="mailto:ben14parks@gmail.com">ben14parks@gmail.com</a>).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Business profile information.</strong> Information about your company,
        such as industry, approximate size, and systems used (for example, QuickBooks Online,
        Procore, or other tools).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Connected system data.</strong> When you connect third-party platforms
        (such as QuickBooks Online), we access accounting and operational data that you
        explicitly authorize through the provider’s OAuth flow. This may include transaction
        records, chart-of-accounts structure, invoice and bill information, and related
        metadata needed to compute readiness metrics and insights.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Owner-provided ROI inputs.</strong> Information you supply about your
        accounting costs, staffing, and related assumptions used to model potential
        productivity or cost-savings ranges.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Usage and log data.</strong> Technical information about how you access
        the Service, such as IP address, browser type, basic usage logs, and diagnostics.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide, maintain, and improve the Service.</li>
      <li>
        Compute AI readiness metrics, banding, and pillar scores for your accounting
        and operational systems.
      </li>
      <li>
        Generate narrative summaries, dashboards, and ROI-focused roadmaps that are
        grounded in your data and owner-provided inputs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Communicate with you about your account, pilot participation, updates,
        and support requests.
      </li>
      <li>
        Monitor, detect, and prevent technical issues, abuse, or security incidents.
      </li>
      <li>
        Comply with legal obligations and enforce our agreements and policies.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Legal Basis (Where Applicable)</h2>
    <p>
      Where required by applicable law, we rely on one or more of the following legal bases
      to process personal information:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your consent (for example, when you authorize a third-party connection).</li>
      <li>
        Our legitimate interests in operating, securing, and improving the Service,
        provided those interests are not overridden by your rights and interests.
      </li>
      <li>Performance of a contract or steps taken at your request before entering a contract.</li>
      <li>Compliance with legal obligations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      We do <strong>not</strong> sell your personal or business data. We may share
      information in the following limited circumstances:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Service providers.</strong> With third-party vendors who perform services
        on our behalf (such as cloud hosting, logging, and analytics) and who are bound
        by obligations to protect your information.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Professional advisors.</strong> With legal, financial, and other advisors
        to obtain professional advice, subject to confidentiality obligations.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Legal and safety.</strong> When we reasonably believe disclosure is necessary
        to comply with law, legal process, or government requests; to protect the safety,
        rights, or property of Arcline, our users, or others; or to enforce our agreements.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Business transfers.</strong> In connection with a merger, acquisition, or
        other change of control of Arcline, subject to appropriate protections.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Platforms and Integrations</h2>
    <p>
      When you connect third-party services (such as QuickBooks Online), those providers’
      own terms and privacy policies apply to their handling of your data. We encourage
      you to review those policies carefully. Arcline accesses only the data that you
      authorize through each provider’s connection flow and uses it solely for the
      purposes described in this Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      We retain information for as long as reasonably necessary to provide the Service,
      support pilot evaluations, meet legal or reporting obligations, resolve disputes,
      and enforce agreements. Where possible, we may aggregate or de-identify data so it
      is no longer reasonably linked to an identifiable person or company.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to help protect the
      information we process, including restricting access to authorized personnel and
      using secure communication channels where appropriate. However, no method of
      transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute
      security.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Your Choices and Rights</h2>
    <p>
      Depending on where you are located and applicable law, you may have certain rights
      with respect to your personal information, such as the right to access, correct, or
      delete personal data we hold about you, or to object to or restrict certain types of
      processing.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make a request, contact us at
      <a href="mailto:ben14parks@gmail.com">ben14parks@gmail.com</a>. We may need to
      verify your identity before responding.
    </p>

    <h2>9. International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>
      Arcline is currently operated from the United States. If you access the Service from
      outside the U.S., your information may be transferred to and processed in the U.S.
      or other countries that may have data-protection laws different from those in your
      country. Where required, we will take steps to ensure an appropriate level of
      protection for cross-border transfers.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The Service is designed for business users and is not directed to children under
      the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under
      16. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact
      us so we can take appropriate action.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will revise
      the “Last updated” date at the top of this page and, where appropriate, provide
      additional notice. Your continued use of the Service after changes become effective
      constitutes your acceptance of the updated Policy.
    </p>
