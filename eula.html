    <h1>End-User License Agreement (EULA) & Terms of Use</h1>
    <p class="muted"><em>Last updated: January 4, 2026</em></p>

    <p>
      This End-User License Agreement and Terms of Use (“Agreement”) is a legal agreement
      between you (“you”, “Customer”, or “User”) and <strong>Arcline</strong> (“Arcline”,
      “we”, “us”, or “our”) that governs your access to and use of our AI readiness and
      data-quality services for construction and trade businesses (the “Service”).
    </p>

    <p>
      By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by this Agreement. If you
      do not agree, do not use the Service.
    </p>

    <h2>1. The Service</h2>
    <p>
      Arcline analyzes data from systems you choose to connect (for example, QuickBooks
      Online) along with owner-provided context to compute readiness metrics, narrative
      summaries, and ROI-oriented roadmaps. The Service is currently provided in a limited
      pilot and may change over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Service is intended for informational and operational-planning purposes only.
      It does not provide tax, accounting, legal, financial, or investment advice.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>
      You may use the Service only if you are at least 18 years old and have the authority
      to enter into this Agreement on behalf of yourself or your organization. By using the
      Service, you represent and warrant that you meet these requirements.
    </p>

    <h2>3. License Grant</h2>
    <p>
      Subject to your compliance with this Agreement, Arcline grants you a limited,
      non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to access and use the Service
      for your internal business purposes during the pilot or subscription term, as
      applicable.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree that you will not, and will not permit others to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to derive the source code of the Service.</li>
      <li>
        Use the Service in any manner that is unlawful, fraudulent, or inconsistent
        with this Agreement.
      </li>
      <li>
        Circumvent or attempt to circumvent any security or authentication measures
        of the Service.
      </li>
      <li>
        Access or use the Service to build a competing product or service or to copy
        any features, functions, or graphics of the Service.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use the Service to process data that you do not have the legal right to process
        or share.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services and Data Connections</h2>
    <p>
      The Service may rely on integrations with third-party platforms, such as QuickBooks
      Online, Procore, or others (each, a “Third-Party Service”). Your use of any
      Third-Party Service is governed by that provider’s terms and privacy policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are responsible for configuring and maintaining your connections to
      Third-Party Services and for ensuring that you have all rights necessary to grant
      Arcline access to the relevant data. Arcline is not responsible for the
      availability, accuracy, or security of any Third-Party Service.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Your Data</h2>
    <p>
      As between you and Arcline, you retain all rights to the data you provide or connect
      to the Service (“Customer Data”). You grant Arcline a non-exclusive, worldwide,
      royalty-free license to host, use, process, and display Customer Data solely as
      necessary to provide and improve the Service, to generate metrics and outputs for
      you, and as otherwise described in this Agreement and our Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are responsible for the accuracy, quality, and legality of Customer Data and for
      obtaining any consents or authorizations that may be required to use the Service.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Outputs and Recommendations</h2>
    <p>
      The Service may generate scores, narrative summaries, dashboards, and ROI estimates
      (“Outputs”). Outputs are based on the data and assumptions available at the time and
      are intended as decision-support tools only. They may not reflect all relevant
      information or future outcomes.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are solely responsible for how you interpret and act on Outputs. Arcline does
      not guarantee any particular savings, revenue, or performance results.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>
      Arcline and its licensors own all rights, title, and interest in and to the Service,
      including all software, algorithms, models, templates, documentation, and
      non-Customer-specific data or insights derived from use of the Service, subject to
      your rights in Customer Data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing in this Agreement grants you any ownership rights in the Service or in any
      Arcline trademarks or logos.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Feedback</h2>
    <p>
      If you provide feedback, suggestions, or ideas about the Service (“Feedback”), you
      grant Arcline a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free license to use that
      Feedback for any purpose, including to improve and market the Service, without any
      obligation to you.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Confidentiality</h2>
    <p>
      Each party agrees to use reasonable care to protect the other party’s confidential
      information and to use it only for purposes related to this Agreement. This does not
      apply to information that is or becomes publicly available, was already known to the
      receiving party, is independently developed, or is lawfully received from a third
      party without restriction.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>
      THE SERVICE AND ALL OUTPUTS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” WITHOUT
      WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING
      BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARCLINE DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, OR
      COMPLETELY SECURE, OR THAT ANY OUTPUTS WILL BE ACCURATE, COMPLETE, OR SUITABLE
      FOR YOUR PARTICULAR USE CASE.
    </p>

    <h2>12. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ARCLINE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY
      INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES,
      OR FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR GOODWILL, ARISING OUT OF OR
      RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
      POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
    </p>
    <p>
      TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ARCLINE’S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY
      FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SERVICE
      WILL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF (A) THE AMOUNTS YOU PAID TO ARCLINE FOR THE
      SERVICE DURING THE SIX (6) MONTHS PRIOR TO THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE
      CLAIM, OR (B) ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS (US$100).
    </p>

    <h2>13. Indemnity</h2>
    <p>
      You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Arcline from and against any claims,
      losses, liabilities, damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’
      fees) arising out of or related to (a) your use of the Service, (b) your violation
      of this Agreement, or (c) any Customer Data or Outputs used outside of the Service.
    </p>

    <h2>14. Term and Termination</h2>
    <p>
      This Agreement remains in effect while you access or use the Service. We may suspend
      or terminate your access to the Service at any time if we believe you have violated
      this Agreement, if we discontinue the Service, or as otherwise reasonably necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon termination, your license to use the Service will cease, but Sections that by
      their nature should survive (including those related to intellectual property,
      confidentiality, disclaimers, limitations of liability, and indemnity) will remain
      in effect.
    </p>

    <h2>15. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>
      This Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State
      of Illinois, USA, without regard to its conflict-of-laws principles. You and Arcline
      agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located
      in Illinois for any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
      Service.
    </p>

    <h2>16. Changes to This Agreement</h2>
    <p>
      We may modify this Agreement from time to time. When we do, we will update the “Last
      updated” date above and, where appropriate, provide additional notice. By continuing
      to use the Service after changes take effect, you agree to the updated Agreement.
